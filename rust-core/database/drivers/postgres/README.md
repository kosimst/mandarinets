Mandarine Postgres. A rust-based stable postgres driver for [Deno](https://deno.land)

## Description
Mandarine Postgres is the main postgres driver for [Mandarine Framework](https://deno.land/x/mandarinets). Although, this driver is not dependent on Mandarine whatsoever which makes it usable for any use case in Deno.

Under the hood, this driver makes use of [`tokio-postgres`](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres) (A rust crate for asynchronous postgres operations).

This driver is officially maintained by the core team of _Mandarine framework_.
